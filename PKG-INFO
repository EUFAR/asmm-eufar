Description: The ASMM (Airborne Science Mission Metadata) Creator is a Python and PyQt based
        GUI utility intended to generate and display XML files conforming to the ASMM standard.
        The purpose of these files is to provide a standard method to describe the various
        parameters and observations of airborne atmospheric science missions, which can then
        be used for dataset discovery after the data has been archived. 
        
        This utility is maintained by EUFAR.
