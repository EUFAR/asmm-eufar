======================================
    - Since the code is stable and no more bug has been found, the software is released in the current state, and version number increases to 0.95. Two stand alone versions have been produced for Linux and Windows : they function with my personal Windows 8.1 Update1 and Ubuntu 14.04, they need intensive tests with other windows and linuw operating systems.


October 23 2014, Release version 0.9.5b4
========================================
  FIXED:
    - corrected a bug that make the sentence "closing ASMM Creator ..." appears in the terminal when a document was modified, "Exit" button pushed, and "Cancel" selected when it was asked to save or not [asmm_xml.py].
    - corrected a bug which permits a contact role to be writen in the XML file even if a contact name doesn't exist [asmm_xml.py].
    - corrected a but which crashes the application when a contact role read in the XML file was missing [asmm_xml.py].
    
  MODIFIED:
    - modified path to retrieve fonts to help creation of the stand alone application under Windows [asmm_pdf.py].
    
  ADDED:
    - a licence file to the "fonts" directory to comply with Fedora font licence.
    - the version number to ASMM starting and closing sentence [asmm_creator.py][mainwindow.py].
    

October 22 2014, Release version 0.9.5b3
========================================
  MODIFIED:
    - "asmm_pdf.py" and "asmm_xml.py" have been moved to "functions" directory as they are functions. Code in the main program has been modified according to the new location.


October 21 2014, Release version 0.9.5b2
========================================
    - Some work has been done since the 20th of October to produce a stable stand alone version for Windows and Linux, through PyInstaller.
    
  ADDED:
    - "import netCDF4" was added to help PyInstaller add this module to the stand alone file [asmm_creator.py].
    - "import numpy" was added to help PyInstaller add this module to the stand alone file [asmm_creator.py].
    - titles have been added to the different pages to improve clarity of the code for futur modification [UI_mainwindow.py].
    
  MODIFIED:
    - modified "asmm_pdf.py" code to use free policies on every systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS). PyInstaller had problems to point towards the correct directory.
    
  NON RESOLVED ISSUES:
    - PyInstaller seems to be unable to locate by itself netCDF4 plugins dedicated to python. Temporary solution: the ".spec" file has been modified to include manually the netCDF4 plugins.
    - On Windows Operating Systemps, in particular Win8.1, the reading of a netcdf file to obtain latitude/longitude coordinates raises an error in the terminal concerning python and the module "win32com". As this module is not called by ASMM Creator, and as ASMM Creator doesn't crash after this error, this issue is not critical and doesn't prevent the use of the software.
